# Intro Page

My name is Ruoyihan Wang (Cindy).

Currently, I am a first-year student in the university of Cambridge, studying engineering.

In my spare time, I enjoy photographing, reading novels, K-pop dancing and travelling ...

I did some really interesting projects this term and I'd like to share some of themï¼š

1.**Lego Mindstorm**

Created the 'gearbox' project by using different sensors to figure out the power of different gears in a team of three.

Measuring the turning speed of different gear box and utilizing Python for controlling the mating of different gears.

2.**Integrated Electrical Project**

Applied signal theory in building modulation, tuning, and filter circuits.

Acquired hands-on experience using LTSpice, PicoScope, multimeters, and microprocessors.
